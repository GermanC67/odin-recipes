        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This versatile Tex-Mex ground beef and potato skillet works as the
            filling for a lettuce wrap, or as a nacho topping. It also works as
            a filling for corn or flour tortillas, or as a hash-type dish, for
            fried eggs. Make this even spicier with the addition of sliced
            jalapeños, as many as you dare! Avocado slices and sour cream are
            also nice toppings for this tasty skillet meal.

            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>

            <li>4 cups frozen O'Brien potatoes, thawed (see Note)</li>

            <li>
                1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chilies (such as
                RO*TEL® Tomatoes and Green Chilies)
            </li>

            <li>2 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>

            <li>2 green onions, sliced</li>

            <li>fresh cilantro sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.
                    When oil shimmers, add ground beef. Cook and stir beef in
                    the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 8 minutes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Sprinkle taco seasoning, chili powder, cumin, smoked
                    paprika, garlic granules, cayenne, salt, and pepper over
                    beef, and stir to combine. Cook 1 to 2 minutes more.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Stir in potatoes and cook 2 to 3 minutes, then add RO*TEL
                    tomatoes, with juice. Cook until potatoes are tender and
                    most of the liquid is absorbed, 4 to 5 minutes more.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
